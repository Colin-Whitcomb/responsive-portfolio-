## Summary & Process

In this assignment our objective was to create a responsive portfolio webpage utilizing Bootstrap's grid system. 

I began by conceptualizing the framework of working elements through an extensive pseduocode process; however, some of these plans transformed. My initial coding created the base elements that would be shared across multiple pages (i.e. Navbar, Footer, background etc...) on the contact page - moving to the home page and portfolio afterwards. 

Although I made sure that my pages and images were responsive, I also took the time to add a sticky footer, utilized nested rows in the portfolio page, added some shadow elements, and rounded all image corners (see below). Additionally, I linked the name button to my LinkedIn account and added the subtext accordingly.
